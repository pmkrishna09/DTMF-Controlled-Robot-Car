# 🤖 DTMF Controlled Robot Car – Project Insights 🚗📱

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to the behind-the-scenes tour of my **DTMF Controlled Robot Car** project – a thrilling journey where electronics, telecommunication, and robotics collide to create something super cool 🚀!

---

## 🎯 Objective

Design and develop a robot car that responds to your mobile phone's keypad tones via **DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency)** signals to navigate and perform tasks – *wirelessly and in real time!* 🎛️🔊

---

## 🧠 What Sparked This Idea?

Ever thought of controlling a robot using your phone? 📲💡  
Well, I wanted to create a remote-controlled vehicle that could assist in rescue operations, surveillance missions, or even just geeky home automation fun! 🕵️‍♂️🎮

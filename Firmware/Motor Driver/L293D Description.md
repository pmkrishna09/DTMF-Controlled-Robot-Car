# ⚙️ Motor Driver – L293D Overview

## 🧠 What is a Motor Driver?

A **Motor Driver** like the **L293D** is the brain’s muscle in your robot! 🧠💪  
While your Arduino *thinks*, the motor driver *acts* — by handling the power and current needed to spin the wheels of your robot.

L293D is a **Quadruple Half H-Bridge** driver IC — it allows a **microcontroller** to control **two DC motors** or **one stepper motor**, and **in both directions** (forward & reverse).

## 🚗 Role in the DTMF-Controlled Robot Car Project

In this project, the L293D motor driver receives digital instructions from the **Arduino**, based on tones decoded from your **DTMF decoder**. These instructions tell the robot to:

- 🔼 Move Forward  
- 🔽 Move Backward  
- ⬅️ Turn Left  
- ➡️ Turn Right  
- 🛑 Stop  

The L293D makes it all possible by directing current to the motors safely and efficiently!

# üß† **Role of Arduino UNO in the DTMF Robot Car Project**

The **Arduino UNO** plays a **central role** in the DTMF Controlled Robot Car project. Here's a breakdown of its functions:
The Arduino Uno is a popular, open-source microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P, featuring 14 digital and 6 analog pins, a USB connection, and a power jack, all controlled by the Arduino IDE software. 
Awesome! Here's how you can include this in your **GitHub repository README** under the **DTMF Controlled Robot Car** project.

The **Arduino UNO** acts as the **brain** of the robot, handling all logic, signal processing, and control tasks. Its main responsibilities include:

---

## üîå 1. **Signal Interpretation**
- It receives **digital output signals** from the **MT8870 DTMF Decoder**.
- Each key press on the mobile phone generates a unique DTMF tone, which is decoded into a 4-bit binary signal.
- The Arduino reads these binary values via 4 input pins and **maps them to movement commands** (e.g., forward, back, stop).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. **Decision-Making Logic**
- Based on the input signal, the Arduino executes predefined **control logic**.
- Uses `if-else` or `switch-case` statements to decide:
  - Which motors to turn ON/OFF
  - In which direction (forward, reverse)
  - When to stop

---

## üöó 3. **Motor Control**
- Sends control signals to the **L293D motor driver**.
- The motor driver amplifies these signals and drives the **DC motors** to move the robot.
- The Arduino determines:
  - Left/right motor direction
  - Speed (if PWM is used in an advanced version)

---

## üîÅ 4. **Real-Time Operation**
- Continuously runs in a loop, checking for new DTMF inputs and responding instantly.
- Provides **responsive real-time control** based on user input from the mobile keypad.

---

### üì° Optional Extensions (Future Scope)
With Arduino UNO, you can later expand functionality:
- Add **sensors** (IR, ultrasonic) for obstacle detection
- Include a **camera module**
- Use **PWM** for speed control
- Upgrade to **gesture or voice control**

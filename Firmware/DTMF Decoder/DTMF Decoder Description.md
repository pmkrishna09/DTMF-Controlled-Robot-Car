# 🎯 **Role of DTMF Decoder (MT8870)**

You can check the complete details about MT8870 DTMF Decoder (https://www.electronicwings.com/sensors-modules/mt8870-dtmf-decoder)

The **MT8870** DTMF decoder is the *brain* behind understanding what key you pressed on your phone! ☎️

## 🔍 What It Does:
- 🎵 **Receives DTMF tones** (Dual Tone Multi-Frequency) sent from a mobile phone keypad.
- 🎛️ **Decodes these tones** into 4-bit binary digital signals.
- 📤 **Sends digital output** to the Arduino to interpret the command (forward, backward, left, right, etc.)

## ✅ Why It’s Important:
| 🔧 Component | 📌 Role |
|-------------|---------|
| 🎧 DTMF Input | Receives audio tones from phone (via mic or 3.5mm jack) |
| 🔄 Tone Detection | Recognizes combination of two frequencies per button |
| 🧠 Decoder Logic | Converts tone into binary equivalent (e.g., ‘2’ → `0010`) |
| 🔌 Digital Output | Sends binary to microcontroller (Arduino UNO) for action |
